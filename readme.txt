As part of the Horizon Europe project BatWoMan, several digital twin and simulation tools have been developed to optimize and scale up key steps in lithium-ion battery cell production. These tools offer a virtual representation of complex manufacturing processes, enabling data-driven control, predictive adjustments, and process optimization.

CIDETEC Energy Storage developed tools focused on electrode processing — including coating and drying, calendering, wetting, and performance simulation. This work allows manufacturers to test and optimize process parameters virtually, reducing waste, enhancing product consistency, and accelerating development cycles.

At the University of Duisburg-Essen, under the leadership of Harry Hoster (Chair of Energy Technology), additional tools were created to simulate interdependencies across the entire process chain. These system-level simulations — developed by Mauritz Biebl — help assess how upstream process variations influence downstream quality, supporting holistic optimization strategies.

 

Together, these digital twin and simulation tools lay the foundation for smart, scalable, and sustainable battery manufacturing — a core objective of the BatWoMan project.
